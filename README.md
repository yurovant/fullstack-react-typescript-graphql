## React + TypeScript + GraphQL

### Get started

This repository containts a "full-stack" application, for which you need to have both the `server` and `client` running. Therefore you need to run the following command in both directories at the same time:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

After this you'd have a local GraphQL server running on [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql) and a local React application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
